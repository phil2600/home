;;; Commentary:

;; TODO:
;;
;; - better documentation
;; - key bindings, perhaps
;; - allow field insertion, a la BibTeX mode
;; - generalize comment types - right now these reflect my personal
;;   style and the fact that I'm doing all of my work in C++.

;; - Replace *! by **. This means that always the first sentence is
;;   used as the short description.
;; - Removed dummy text, takes only time to remove this.
